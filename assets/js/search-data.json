            "content": "This post is part of a series that will discuss the mathematical preliminaries for starting off into Differential Geometry . . Categories . A Category C mathcal{C}C consists of . A class of objects ObC text{Ob}_{ mathcal{C}}ObC​ | A set of morphisms1 MorC(A,B) text{Mor}_{ mathcal{C}}(A,B)MorC​(A,B) for any two objects A,B∈ObCA, B in Ob_{C}A,B∈ObC​ | A composition operation MorC(X,Y)×MorC(Y,Z)→MorC(X,Z) text{Mor}_{ mathcal{C}}(X,Y) times text{Mor}_{ mathcal{C}}(Y,Z) to text{Mor}_{ mathcal{C}}(X,Z)MorC​(X,Y)×MorC​(Y,Z)→MorC​(X,Z) or (f,g)↦g∘f(f,g) mapsto g circ f(f,g)↦g∘f for any three objects X,Y,Z∈ObCX, Y, Z in text{Ob}_{ mathcal{C}}X,Y,Z∈ObC​. and the following axioms | For any four objects X,Y,Z,W∈ObCX, Y, Z, W in text{Ob}_{ mathcal{C}}X,Y,Z,W∈ObC​ and any morphisms f∈MorC(X,Y),g∈MorC(Y,Z),h∈MorC(Z,W)f in text{Mor}_{ mathcal{C}}(X,Y), g in text{Mor}_{ mathcal{C}}(Y,Z), h in text{Mor}_{ mathcal{C}}(Z,W)f∈MorC​(X,Y),g∈MorC​(Y,Z),h∈MorC​(Z,W) it is true that | . h∘(g∘f)=(h∘g)∘fh circ (g circ f) = (h circ g) circ fh∘(g∘f)=(h∘g)∘f . There exists an unique morphism 1X∈MorC(X,X)1_{X} in text{Mor}_{ mathcal{C}}(X,X)1X​∈MorC​(X,X) called identity morphism such that for any f∈MorC(X,Y)f in text{Mor}_{ mathcal{C}}(X,Y)f∈MorC​(X,Y) and g∈MorC(Y,X)g in text{Mor}_{ mathcal{C}}(Y,X)g∈MorC​(Y,X) the followidng identities hold | . f∘1X=ff circ 1_{X} = ff∘1X​=f . 1X∘g=g1_{X} circ g = g1X​∘g=g . A morphism f∈MorC(X,Y)f in text{Mor}_{ mathcal{C}}(X,Y)f∈MorC​(X,Y) is said to be an isomorphism if there exists another morphism g∈MorC(Y,X)g in text{Mor}_{ mathcal{C}}(Y,X)g∈MorC​(Y,X) such that f∘g=1Yf circ g = 1_{Y}f∘g=1Y​ and g∘f=1Xg circ f = 1_{X}g∘f=1X​. Two objects are said to be isomorphic if there exists an isomorphism between them. An endomorphism is a morphism on the same object, i.e. ∈MorC(X,X) in text{Mor}_{ mathcal{C}}(X,X)∈MorC​(X,X). It is also denoted by EndC(X) text{End}_{ mathcal{C}}(X)EndC​(X). A morphism fff is said to be automorphic if it is both isomorphic and endomorphic. It is also denoted by AutC(X) text{Aut}_{ mathcal{C}}(X)AutC​(X) . EXAMPLE: Category of Sets. The objects are the sets, the morphisms are the maps between sets, the composition operation is the ordinary composition of maps and 1X1_{X}1X​ is the identity map of XXX. Ismorphisms are the bijective maps, and two sets are isomorphic iff they have the same cardinality. Automorphisms are the group of permutations of the elements of the set. . Diagram . Diagrams are Graph Theoretic representation of Categories where each category is assigned a directed graph: the vertices represent the objects of the category and the edges represent the morphisms of the category. Any path connecting any two vertices is a morphism (directed along the edge) from one objet to the other. The morphism is given by the composition of the morphisms of the consecutive edges making up the path. . . A diagram is said to be commutative if, for any two different paths connecting any two vertices, the corresponding morphism is the same. For example, in the above image, if f=f2∘f1f=f_{2} circ f_1f=f2​∘f1​ and g∘f=g′∘f′g circ f=g&amp;#x27; circ f&amp;#x27;g∘f=g′∘f′, then the diagram is said to be commmutative. . Functor . A Functor is like an operator between categories which assigns objects of one category to the other and morphisms of one to the other. . Covariant Functor . Covariant functor associates to each object X∈ObCX in text{Ob}_{ mathcal{C}}X∈ObC​ an object F(X)∈ObDF(X) in text{Ob}_{ mathcal{D}}F(X)∈ObD​, and to each morphism f∈MorC(X,Y)f in text{Mor}_{ mathcal{C}}(X,Y)f∈MorC​(X,Y) a morphism F(f)∈MorD(F(X),F(Y))F(f) in text{Mor}_{ mathcal{D}}(F(X),F(Y))F(f)∈MorD​(F(X),F(Y)) such that . identity morphism of any object X∈ObCX in text{Ob}_{ mathcal{C}}X∈ObC​ is associated to identity morphism of the corresponding object F(X)∈ObDF(X) in text{Ob}_{ mathcal{D}}F(X)∈ObD​ | . F(1X)=1F(X)F(1_{X})=1_{F(X)}F(1X​)=1F(X)​ . morphism association is distributive over composition operator | . F(g∘f)=F(g)∘F(f)F(g circ f)=F(g) circ F(f)F(g∘f)=F(g)∘F(f) . Contravariant Functor . Contravariant functor is almost same as Covariant Functor excecpt that it’s not. The object association is same as for Covariant functor. But morphism association happens in a twisted manner. Each morphism f∈MorC(X,Y)f in text{Mor}_{ mathcal{C}}(X,Y)f∈MorC​(X,Y) is associated to F(f)∈MorD(F(Y),F(X))F(f) in text{Mor}_{ mathcal{D}}(F(Y),F(X))F(f)∈MorD​(F(Y),F(X)) (notice the change). This results in a change in the second property: . F(g∘f)=F(f)∘F(g)F(g circ f)=F(f) circ F(g)F(g∘f)=F(f)∘F(g) . Opposite Category . There is darkness and light, good and evil, life and death, beginning and end. And then there is Category and Opposite Category . For each Category C mathcal{C}C there exists an Opposite Category Cop mathcal{C}^{ text{op}}Cop. The opposite category has the same objects as the original category, i.e. Cop=C mathcal{C}^{ text{op}}= mathcal{C}Cop=C, except that MorCop(A,B)=MorC(B,A) text{Mor}_{ mathcal{C}^{ text{op}}}(A,B)= text{Mor}_{ mathcal{C}}(B,A)MorCop​(A,B)=MorC​(B,A), and the composition operator rule is f∘opg=g∘ff circ^{ text{op}} g = g circ ff∘opg=g∘f. With this definition, a contravariant functor from categories C mathcal{C}C to D mathcal{D}D can be defined as functors from Cop mathcal{C}^{ text{op}}Cop to D mathcal{D}D or from C mathcal{C}C to Dop mathcal{D}^{ text{op}}Dop. . Natural Transformation . A natural transformation Φ PhiΦ acts on two functors FFF and GGG operating between two categories C mathcal{C}C and D mathcal{D}D and it associates for each X∈ObCX in text{Ob}_{ mathcal{C}}X∈ObC​ a morphism ΦX∈MorD(F(X),G(X)) Phi_{X} in text{Mor}_{ mathcal{D}}(F(X),G(X))ΦX​∈MorD​(F(X),G(X)) so that for any morphism f∈MorC(X,Y)f in text{Mor}_{ mathcal{C}}(X,Y)f∈MorC​(X,Y), the following diagram is commutative. . . A natural isomorphism is a natural transformation where ΦX Phi_{X}ΦX​ is an isomorphism for all X∈ObCX in text{Ob}_{ mathcal{C}}X∈ObC​. . So, isormophisms just mean the way they sound - two entities are isomporhic if they are identical; they behave the same way. So if there exists a natural isomorphism between two functors then they are both essentially the same. . Also known as maps or arrows &#8617; . |",
